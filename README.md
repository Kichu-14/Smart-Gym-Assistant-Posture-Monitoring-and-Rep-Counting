| `Dataset.ipynb`        | Extracts video frames, converts them to grayscale, resizes images, and labels them for CNN training. |
| `Train_Video.ipynb`    | Captures live push-up footage to generate and store labeled image samples for dataset creation.      |
| `Training_model.ipynb` | Defines and trains a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras to classify correct and incorrect postures.    |
| `Prediction.ipynb`     | Applies MediaPipe for real-time pose tracking and uses the trained model to evaluate form and count reps. |
